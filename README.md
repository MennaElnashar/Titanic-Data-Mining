# Titanic-Data-Mining

The "Titanic-Data-Mining" project is a college project. The objective of the project is to apply data pre-processing techniques and implement data mining algorithms on the Titanic dataset.

# The project consists of several files:

1) Jupyter notebook: "Data Mining Project (Jupyter Notebook)": This notebook contains the code and documentation for the project. It includes data pre-processing steps, implementation of data mining algorithms, and the analysis of results.

2) Training dataset: "Titanic_train": This dataset is used for training the data mining models. It contains a subset of the Titanic dataset, including various features such as passenger information, ticket details, and survival status.

3) Test dataset: "Titanic_test": This dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the trained models. It contains similar features to the training dataset but lacks the survival status information.

4) Project Report: "Data Mining Report": This report provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including the problem statement, methodology, data pre-processing steps, details of data mining algorithms used, results, and conclusions.

For this project, I utilized popular data mining and machine learning libraries in Python, such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy. These libraries provide a wide range of tools and algorithms for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

By analyzing the Titanic dataset, applying data pre-processing techniques, and implementing data mining algorithms, I uncovered patterns, correlations, and insights that can help predict survival outcomes on the Titanic.
